I have worked developing apps for six months. During that period I learned how to manage projects, full stack development and how teamworking works in a corporate enviroment.
I finished my programming studies last year and have also finished computer technician studies.

I'm currently studying videogame development and VR in hopes of bettering my artistic skills and moreover, expand my programming horizons.
