## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Conan Montes and I'm 20. I am a software developer and aspiring game developer who is skilled in C# developing, though I know my way around other languages such as Javascript, Python, Java and Kotlin. 

### ðŸ”­ What have I done?
I have worked developing apps for six months. During that period I learned how to manage projects, full stack development and how teamworking works in a corporate enviroment.
I finished my programming studies last year and have also finished computer technician studies.

### âš¡ As of right now...
I'm currently studying videogame development and VR in hopes of bettering my artistic skills and moreover, expand my programming horizons.

### ðŸ’¬ How would you describe yourself?
I would say I'm a driven person who loves to have a goal to pursuit and continue broadening his horizons.

I'm open to answering all questions and looking forward to continue learning âœ¨
