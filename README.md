# 👋 HELLO THERE

***<p style="float: right"> My name is Conan Montes and I'm 21. I am a software developer and aspiring game developer who is skilled in C# programming, though I know my way around other languages such as Javascript, Dart, Java and Kotlin.</p>***

## 🏆 Achivements
I have worked developing apps for six months as a programmer at Bodegas Fundador. During that period I learned how to manage projects, full stack development and how teamworking is in a corporate enviroment. I was hired again later and I am currently working developing VR experiences for the company.

I studied multiplatform apps programming and microinformatic systems and networking. I specialised in videogame development and VR.

## 🌱 Work in progress
I'm currently learning flutter and improving my skills in the usage of Blender.

## 💬 Description
I would say I'm a driven person who loves to have a goal to pursuit and continue broadening his horizons.

I'm open to answering all questions and looking forward to continue learning 📚
